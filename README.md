## BSAN 360 Final Project

This project analyzes U.S. used car resale prices to understand how vehicle characteristics
and market factors affect resale value. Using multiple linear regression, ANOVA, pivot tables,
and data visualizations, the analysis shows that brand, car type, and region explain significantly
more price variation than mileage or age alone.
